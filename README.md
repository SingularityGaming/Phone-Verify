>MW19 does not require a phone number. The new Modern Warfare II does and there is no workaround. Get yourself a Turkish phone number; a SIM card costs a couple of dollars at most.

>That’s a great question. In short, not really. As someone else mentioned VOIP is typically not allowed (idk about COD specifically). More importantly, there’s little reason for a cheater to stick around COD if the cost is just high enough.

>They might get multiple SIMs but if they keep getting banned, what’s the point if they can just cheat in a different game with far less hassle? Idk if there is anything super special about COD that other FPSs don’t bring to the table.

>The cheaters that specifically target COD and have enough fuck you money to keep buying SIM cards then becomes quite small.

>But to your point, I will say that in other games that require phone numbers I know for sure people buy sims and farm accounts to sell them (and I’m sure the same thing will happen in COD). But even these businesses are slowly getting defeated as gaming companies catch up to their methods while leaving general gameplay unaffected (Valve is one company that’s done a good job of this).
